# Advent-of-code

My codes for the challenges of adventofcode.com

**TODO**

day 22 of 2015 (totally uninteresting)


**Challenges that have caused me some problems/ that I have failed to do alone :**

2021::24 : reverse engineering

2015::15 : Mixed-integer non linear problem. So hard for a day 15 problem.
